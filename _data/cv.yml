    - title: Head of Machine Learning
      institution: Sublime Security
      year: 2022
      description:
        - Designed and co-developed ADÉ (Autonomous Detection Engineer), a specialized coding agent that writes detections through a knowledge base, tool use, and specialized sub-agents
        - Co-authored an agent evaluation framework for LLM-generated security rules with hold-out human baselines; introduced metrics for detection accuracy (unique-TP precision), brittleness→robustness, and cost-to-pass syntactic validation
        - Architected ASA (Autonomous Security Analyst), a deep reasoning agent for triaging phishing emails
        - Created a computer vision model for the detection and identification of brand impersonation and phishing portals
        - Designed a natural language understanding model to perform intent classification and named entity recognition
        - Optimized the models to reduce computer resource consumption, enabling them to operate efficiently on millions of emails daily and reducing the cost of computing resources.
    
    - title: Senior Manager, Security Machine Learning
      institution: Elastic
      year: 2019-2022
      description:
        - Responsible for recruiting and hiring (3x growth in 18 months).
        - Sets research agenda by collaborating with cross-functional teams to design product features that leverage machine learning.
        - Manages ML projects, including identifying data needs, setting go/no-go performance metrics, and communicating to stakeholders.
        - Technical lead of Insights Initiative, an ML-backed approach to improving alert triage experience within the Elastic Security App.
        - Focuses research on holistic ML approach (supervised + unsupervised learning) on tailoring detection experience to local environments.
        - Researching the use of language models to detect anomalous behavior in event data.
        - Built ML service on top of alert feedback data to reduce global false positives by ~40% within 48 hours post-model releases.

      institution: Endgame (acquired by Elastic)
      year: 2015-2019
      description:
        - Recruited and led a distributed Data Scientists and Engineers team focused on delivering ML features and critical data pipeline enablers.
        - Acted as an independent monitor of ML projects to track progress, identify challenges, and present results to key stakeholders.
        - Designed and developed Artemis, a natural language interface for querying security event data.
        - Developed ML features for a static PE binary malware classifier.
        - Designed an Adversarial ML service for tree-based classifiers to discover blind spots and identify potential decay.
        - Designed and implemented an Active Learning interface for increasing NLP model efficacy. 

    - title: Senior Data Scientist
      institution: Battelle Memorial Institute
      year: 2011-2015
      description:
        - Designed and implemented a social media collection, analysis, and visualization platform.
        - Developed an authorship attribution model for source code attribution.
        - Built a model to demonstrate information diffusion within small online communities and predict future propagation
