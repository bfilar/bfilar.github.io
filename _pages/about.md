Hello, Iâ€™m Bobby Filar, a machine learning researcher and currently the Head of Data Science at [Sublime Security](https://sublime.security/), the first truly open email security platform. I lead our efforts in integrating machine learning capabilities into our product, aiming to make it more intuitive for users and combat sophisticated attacks. Before joining Sublime Security, I was at the helm of Security Machine Learning teams at Endgame and Elastic. During my time at Endgame, I introduced Artemis, a groundbreaking intelligent assistant for cyber defense. This innovative tool allowed security analysts to interact with endpoint data through natural language, streamlining the investigation process and significantly enhancing decision-making in cybersecurity. My work has consistently focused on SecML research, particularly in malware classification and assistive ML.

My passion lies in augmenting security workers' day-to-day operations through:

Natural language understanding
Reinforcement learning
Adversarial machine learning
I'm driven by the challenge of developing solutions that not only safeguard data but also empower security professionals to work more efficiently and effectively.
