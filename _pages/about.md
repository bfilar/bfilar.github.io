Hello, I'm Bobby Filar, a machine learning researcher and currently the Head of Data Science at [Sublime Security](https://sublime.security/), the first truly open email security platform. I lead our efforts in integrating machine learning capabilities into our product, aiming to make it more intuitive for users and more robust to sophisticated attacks. Before Sublime Security, I led Security Machine Learning teams at Endgame and Elastic, focusing on SecML research, particularly in malware classification and assistive ML.

I'm really interested in augmenting security workers' day-to-day operations via:
- Natural language understanding 
- Reinforcement learning
- Adversarial machine learning
