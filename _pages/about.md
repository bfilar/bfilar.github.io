Hello, I'm Bobby Filar, a machine learning researcher and currently the Head of Data Science at [Sublime Security](https://sublime.security/). I lead our efforts in integrating machine learning into our email security platform, aiming to make it more robust and intelligent. Prior to Sublime Security, I led Security Machine Learning teams at Endgame and Elastic, focusing on SecML research, particularly in malware classification and assistive-ML. I'm really interested in the use of reinforcement learning, adversarial machine learning, and natural language understanding to help augment security workers day-to-day operations.
